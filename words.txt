We choose to do "Hello World" testing mainly to achieve our goal, i.e., to find out the minimal overhead of each framework. 
Many people complain that the "Hello World" application is meaningless because a real world application often needs to deal 
with more complex tasks, such as database queries. This is not very true. In reality, especially in a large scale Web 2.0 application, 
we often encounter scenarios that are very close to "Hello World". For example, an application may need to respond to an AJAX request 
that should return the current server timestamp; a page has a large portion of its content being cached and an application just needs to 
fetch the cached content and display it.
